# Simple Mobile Robot for ROS2 Learning

This repository contains a **basic mobile robot simulation** designed for understanding the fundamentals of **ROS2** (Robot Operating System 2). The robot is equipped with three essential sensors, making it perfect for beginners and those looking to learn sensor integration and robot control using ROS2:

- **LIDAR**: Used for obstacle detection and environment mapping.
- **Camera**: Provides basic visual feedback.
- **Depth Camera**: Offers depth perception for advanced navigation tasks.

The robot is set up to work in simulation environments such as **Gazebo**, allowing users to explore concepts like sensor data processing, navigation, and robot control.
